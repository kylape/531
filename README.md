# 5/3/1 Program Calculator

Calculate the weight for each set of each exercise in the 5/3/1 base program.
I'll probably continue to extend the script to be more flexible as I continue
using the program.

`maxes.conf` has the actual max lifts.  The assistance lifts are coded into the
script still, so those will need to be updated if different assistance lifts
are used.

The program is currently configured to use BBB (Boring but Big) for assistance.

## Running

Put your lift maxes into `maxes.conf` and run `./531.py`.
